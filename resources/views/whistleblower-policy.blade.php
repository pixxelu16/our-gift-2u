         <h2>Whistleblower policy </h2>
         <p>52 Orange (‘52 Degree’) is committed to the highest standards of conduct and ethical behavior in all of our business activities and to promoting and supporting a culture of honest and ethical behavior, corporate compliance, and good corporate governance.</p>
         <p>52 Orange encourages the reporting of any instances of suspected unethical, illegal, fraudulent, or undesirable conduct involving 52 Orange and provides protections and measures so that those persons who make a report may do so confidentially and without fear of intimidation, disadvantage, or reprisal.</p>
         <p>The objectives of this Policy are to:</p>
         <p>(a) provide Whistleblowers with a clear framework within which to make an allegation as a&nbsp; Protected Disclosure;</p>
         <p>(b) ensure any reports of Reportable Conduct are dealt with appropriately;</p>
         <p>(c) provide Whistleblowers with a clear understanding of how allegations will be handled;</p>
         <p>(d) protect Whistleblowers from victimization, detriment, and retaliation; (e) support Whistleblowers throughout the reporting process; and</p>
         <p>(f) afford natural justice and procedural fairness to anyone who is the subject of an allegation of Reportable Conduct.</p>
         <p>This policy will be made available via the 52 Orange website and internal information-sharing channels.</p>
         <p>Application</p>
         <p>The Policy applies to:</p>
         <p>(a) a current or former:</p>
         <p>(1) employee of 52 Orange&nbsp; ;</p>
         <p>(2) officer of 52 Orange&nbsp; ;</p>
         <p>(3) contractor, or an employee of a contractor who has supplied goods or services to&nbsp; 52 Orange; or</p>
         <p>(4) associated individuals of 52 Orange.</p>
         <p>(b) a spouse, relative, or dependant of one of the people referred to at (a);</p>
         <p>who makes or attempts to make a Protected Disclosure (whether anonymously or not) (each a Whistleblower).</p>
         <p>Policy</p>
         <ol>
            <li>What is Reportable Conduct?</li>
         </ol>
         <p>52 Orange promotes a culture that encourages the reporting of Reportable Conduct and where a Whistleblower makes a Protected Disclosure, that person will be protected under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) including from disciplinary action,&nbsp; victimization, detriment, retaliation, or claims by 52 Orange as a result of having made the report.</p>
         <p>A “Protected Disclosure” is a report of Reportable Conduct made in accordance with the&nbsp; Policy.</p>
         <p>Reportable Conduct is any of the following conduct (or the deliberate concealment of such&nbsp; conduct) that a Whistleblower has reasonable grounds to suspect raises any concern&nbsp; (whether actual or suspected) in relation to 52 Orange or a related body corporate (including its officers and employees):</p>
         <p>(a) conduct which constitutes an improper state of affairs or circumstances in relation to&nbsp; 52 Orange or a related body corporate;</p>
         <p>(b) fraud, negligence, default, breach of trust, and breach of duties under the Corporations&nbsp; Act;</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>(c) conduct which constitutes an offense against, or contravention of:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>the Corporations Act or an instrument made under it, or other financial sector laws enforced by the Australian Securities Investments Commission (ASIC) or the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA); or</li>
            <li>any other law of the Commonwealth that is punishable by imprisonment for a period of 12 months or more; or</li>
         </ol>
         <p>(d) conduct which represents a significant risk to public safety or the stability of, or confidence in the financial system (even if it is not a breach of a particular law).</p>
         <p>Examples of Reportable Conduct:</p>
         <p>Disclosable matters may include conduct that may not involve a contravention of a particular law but may indicate a systemic issue that the regulator should know about to properly perform its functions. Examples of Reportable Conduct include:</p>
         <p>(a) dishonest, fraudulent, or corrupt behavior, including bribery;</p>
         <p>(b) criminal conduct (such as theft, violence, harassment or intimidation, criminal damage to&nbsp; property, or other breaches of state or federal law);</p>
         <p>(c) failure to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation;</p>
         <p>(d) unethical or in breach of 52 Orange policies (such as dishonestly altering company records or data, adopting questionable accounting practices, or wilfully breaching 52 Orange’s Code of&nbsp; Conduct or other policies or procedures);</p>
         <p>(e) conduct potentially damaging to 52 Orange, a 52 Orange employee, or a third party, such as unsafe work practices, risks to or abuse of 52 Orange’ property or resources;</p>
         <p>(f) conduct amounting to an abuse of authority;</p>
         <p>(g) conduct that may cause financial loss to 52 Orange damage its reputation or be otherwise detrimental to 52 Orange’ interests;</p>
         <p>(h) harassment, discrimination, victimization, or bullying.</p>
         <ol start="2">
            <li>What is not Reportable Conduct?</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Matters that are not Reportable Conduct are not protected by the Corporations Act or the&nbsp; Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) but may be protected under other legislation. Reportable Conduct excludes “personal work-related grievances”, which is a grievances about any matter in relation to the person’s employment (or former employment) having (or&nbsp; tending to have) implications for that person personally, and the information about the&nbsp; grievance:</p>
         <p>(a) does not have significant implications for 52 Orange or another related body corporate that does not relate to the Whistleblower; and</p>
         <p>(b) does not concern conduct that involves an offense or contravention of law. Examples of personal work-related grievances:</p>
         <p>(a) an interpersonal conflict between the Whistleblower and another employee;</p>
         <p>(b) a decision relating to the engagement, transfer, or promotion of the Whistleblower;</p>
         <p>(c) a decision relating to the terms and conditions of engagement of the Whistleblower; and</p>
         <p>(d) a decision to suspend or terminate the engagement of the Whistleblower, or otherwise to discipline the Whistleblower.</p>
         <p>However, there may be some cases when a personal work-related grievance still qualifies&nbsp; for protection under this Policy if it:</p>
         <p>(a) includes information about Reportable Conduct, or forms part of a disclosure which also&nbsp; includes Reportable Conduct;</p>
         <p>(b) the Whistleblower suffers from or is threatened with detriment for making a disclosure of&nbsp; Reportable Conduct;</p>
         <p>(c) The whistleblower seeks legal advice or legal representation about the operation of the whistleblower protections under the Corporations Act.</p>
         <ol start="3">
            <li>Who can I make a report to?</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Provided that you have reported a concern covered by this Policy to an Eligible Recipient&nbsp; (being a person noted in this section), you qualify for protection as a Whistleblower under&nbsp; the Corporations Act, even if you report your concerns anonymously, your disclosure turns&nbsp;</p>
         <p>out to be incorrect or where your legal adviser had advised you that your concern is not covered by the Corporations Act.</p>
         <p>To ensure appropriate escalation and timely investigation, we request that reports be made&nbsp; to any one of our Protected Disclosure Officers, listed below:</p>
         <p>Chief Executive Officer</p>
         <p>Alejandro Romano Email: alejandro@52degree.us</p>
         <p>Additionally, if the Whistleblower is not comfortable or able to report their concerns under this Policy internally, a report may be made via the 52 Orange Whistleblower Service. 52 Orange Whistleblower Service is nominated as a Protected Disclosure Officer for the purposes of this section.</p>
         <p>The reporting options are:</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>Australian Free-call Whistleblower hotline: 1800 319 595</p>
         <p>Email: alejandro@52degree.us</p>
         <p>However, if you provide your contact details to the 52 Orange Whistleblower Service, those contact details or information that may reveal your identity will only be provided to an internal Protected Disclosure Officer if you consent.</p>
         <p>While it is 52 Orange’s preference that you raise reports with the Protected Disclosure Officers referred to above, it is important to note that under the Corporations Act, you may also raise the matter with:</p>
         <p>(a) ASIC (Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission) or APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) or another body prescribed by regulation;</p>
         <p>(b) an “officer” or “senior manager” of 52 Orange or a related body corporate;</p>
         <p>(c) an auditor, or member of an audit team conducting an audit of 52 Orange or a related body corporate;</p>
         <p>(d) an actuary of 52 Orange or a related body corporate;</p>
         <p>(e) a legal practitioner for the purposes of obtaining legal advice or legal representation in&nbsp; relation to matters pertaining to this Policy.</p>
         <p>An officer or senior manager is defined in the Corporations Act as “a director, or a&nbsp; senior manager in the company who makes, or participates in making, decisions that affect&nbsp; the whole, or a substantial part, of the business of the company, or who has the capacity to&nbsp; affect significantly the company’s financial standing.” In limited circumstances, a Whistleblower may be protected by law if they make a public interest disclosure or an emergency disclosure to a journalist or parliamentarian which qualifies for protection under the Corporations Act.</p>
         <p>See Annexure (a) above for more information.</p>
         <p>When making a disclosure under this Policy, you should provide as much information as possible, including the details of the Reportable Conduct, people involved, dates, locations and any other evidence or material that may be relevant. If you are unsure about whether to make a disclosure of Reportable Conduct, you may disclose in confidence to the Chief Legal Officer &amp; Company Secretary. In the event you do not formally make a disclosure under the Policy, 52 Orange may nevertheless be compelled to act on the information you have provided if that information reasonably suggests that Reportable Conduct has occurred or may occur.</p>
         <ol start="4">
            <li>Anonymous reports</li>
         </ol>
         <p>52 Orange encourages a person to provide their name when making a disclosure under this Policy, as it will assist 52 Orange to investigate and address their report.</p>
         <p>However, if you do not want to reveal your identity, you may make an anonymous disclosure under this Policy and may choose to remain anonymous over the course of any investigation and after the investigation is finalized.</p>
         <p>There are various mechanisms available for protecting a Whistleblower’s anonymity when&nbsp; making a disclosure under this Policy, including:</p>
         <p>communicating through the 52 Orange Whistleblower Hotline;</p>
         <p>using an anonymized email address;</p>
         <p>not making the disclosure using 52 Orange systems; and</p>
         <p>adopting a pseudonym (a fictitious name; especially: a pen name.) for the purpose of your disclosure.</p>
         <p>If a Whistleblower chooses to make an anonymous disclosure under this Policy, any investigation will be conducted as best as possible in the circumstances. A Whistleblower may refuse to answer questions that they feel could reveal their identity at any time during the investigation or at any other time. Disclosures that are made anonymously will still be protected under this Policy. However, 52 Orange may be unable to provide a Whistleblower with the same level of practical support and protection if they do not provide their name.</p>
         <p>If a Whistleblower wishes to remain anonymous, they should, where possible, maintain ongoing communication with 52 Orange so that 52 Orange can seek further information or clarification to assist in investigating and addressing their disclosure and provide them with feedback and updates regarding the progress of any investigation and outcomes.</p>
         <ol start="5">
            <li>Consequences of making a false report</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Anyone who knowingly makes a false report of Reportable Conduct, or who otherwise fails to act honestly with reasonable suspicion in respect of the report, may be subject to disciplinary action, including dismissal (in the case of employees) or professional conduct sanction (in the case of members). The disciplinary action or sanction will depend on the severity, nature, and circumstance of the false report.</p>
         <ol start="6">
            <li>52 Orange’ investigation of Reportable Conduct; All reports received by a Protected Disclosure Officer will be acknowledged within 3 business days.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Subject to the confidentiality requirements outlined in this Policy, all disclosures of&nbsp; Reportable Conduct made pursuant to this Policy will be referred to a Whistleblower&nbsp; Investigations Officer (WIO) to assist in the investigation of a report.</p>
         <p>The WIO (Whistleblower Investigations Officer) is Alejandro Romano, Chief Executive Officer</p>
         <p>The WIO (Whistleblower Investigations Officer) will assess the information provided and determine: (a) whether the disclosure related to Reportable Conduct and qualifies for protection under&nbsp; this Policy;</p>
         <p>(b) whether sufficient information exists to allow the report to be investigated, whether an&nbsp; investigation is required, and if so, determine the appropriate investigation process,&nbsp; including:</p>
         <p>the nature and scope of the investigation;</p>
         <p>who will conduct the investigation and whether that person should be external to 52 Orange; the nature of any technical, financial, or legal advice that may be required; and</p>
         <p>a timeframe for the investigation (having regard to the nature and scope of the Reportable&nbsp; Conduct, the complexity of the issues, and any other relevant factors).</p>
         <p>52 Orange may not be able to undertake an investigation in some circumstances, including if it is not able to contact the Whistleblower to obtain consent or information to enable an investigation to proceed.</p>
         <p>The WIO(Whistleblower Investigations Officer) will be in touch with the Whistleblower within 2 weeks of receiving a report from the&nbsp; Whistleblower and will advise of the next steps and timeframes where appropriate.</p>
         <p>Where appropriate, 52 Orange will provide initial feedback to the Whistleblower and keep them informed on a continuing basis regarding the investigation’s progress and/or outcome&nbsp; (subject to considerations of the privacy of those against whom allegations are made).&nbsp; However, if the allegation is referred to the Police or another agency, this may not be possible.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>The investigation will be conducted in an objective and fair manner, and otherwise as is reasonable and appropriate having regard to the nature of the Reportable Conduct and the circumstances.</p>
         <p>The WIO (Whistleblower Investigations Officer) will ensure that any employee mentioned in a Protected Disclosure is not unfairly treated during the course of the investigation of the matter. Employees will have the opportunity to be informed of and respond to any report of Reportable Conduct made against them.</p>
         <ol start="7">
            <li>Protections Available</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Where a Whistleblower has made a report under this Policy they will be eligible for the&nbsp; following protections:</p>
         <p>(a) Identity protection;</p>
         <p>(b) Protection from detrimental acts or omissions;</p>
         <p>(c) Compensation and other remedies; and</p>
         <p>(d) Civil, criminal, and administrative liability protection.</p>
         <p>These protections apply not only to internal disclosures, but to eligible disclosures made to legal practitioners, regulatory and other external bodies, and to “public interest” and&nbsp; “emergency” disclosures that are made in accordance with the Corporations Act.</p>
         <p>7.1 Identity Protection</p>
         <p>52 Orange cannot disclose the Whistleblower’s identity or information that is likely to lead to their identification except:</p>
         <p>(a) to ASIC (Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission), APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority), or a member of the Australian Federal Police;</p>
         <p>(b) to a legal practitioner for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or legal representation&nbsp; about the whistleblowing provisions of the Corporations Act;</p>
         <p>(c) to a person or body prescribed by the Corporations Act regulations; or (d) with the person’s consent.</p>
         <p>The information contained in a disclosure a person has made under this Policy may be&nbsp; disclosed without their consent if the disclosure of this information is reasonably necessary&nbsp; to investigate the issues raised in the report, provided that:</p>
         <p>(a) the information does not include the person’s identity; and</p>
         <p>(b) all reasonable steps have been taken by 52 Orange to reduce the risk that their identity will be revealed from the information provided.</p>
         <p>It is unlawful for a person to identify a Whistleblower, or disclose information that is likely to lead to the identification of the disclosure, outside of the circumstances listed above.</p>
